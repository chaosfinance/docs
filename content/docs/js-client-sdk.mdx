title: Sonic LSD JS SDK
description: Chaos Finance provided a JavaScript package for application developers, making the adoption fast and robust.
---

To add Chaos Finance Sonic LSD into your application, run this in the terminal from the root directory of the application. 

```bash
$ npm install @chaosfinance/sonic-lsd --save
```

Import functions and objects from SDK:

```javascript
import {
    // settings functions
    register,
    registerChain,
    registerWallet,
    updatePublicKey,

    // mutating functions
    stakeSonic,
    unstakeLstSonic,
    withdrawSonic,
    
    // global query functions
    getUserMinStakeAmount,
    getLstApr,
    getLstRate,
    getPlatformFeeCommission,
    getLsdTokenAddress,
    getTotalStakedAmount,
    getTotalLstAmount,
    
    // user query functions
    getUserLstBalance,
    getUserSolBalance,
    getUserSonicBalance,
    getUserStakedAmount,
    getUserWithdrawInfo, WithdrawInfo,
} from "@chaosfinance/sonic-lsd"
```

## Settings Functions

The first step developers should do is register REST endpoint, lsd program configs and wallet related functions. There are three functions involved: `register`, `registerChain` and `registerWallet`. The `register` function is equivalent to executing both `registerChain` and `registerWallet`. 

The `registerChain` doesn't require a connected wallet, but both `register` and `registerWallet` do. Therefore, if your app needs to retrieve on-chain status before connecting wallet, you may call `registerChain`, then you are able to query global infos, such as lst apr, min stake amount, platform fee commission etc. If you got the wallet connected, you can call `register` or `registerWallet` to finish the process, so that you can call mutating functions: stake, unstake, withdraw or user information functions.

<Callout>the lsd program id and stake manager address can be found here: [Deployed Contract Addresses](contract-addresses)</Callout>

### register()

```javascript
const wallet = // Get the wallet object that user selected
await wallet.connect()

register(
    {
        restEndpoint:        'https://api.testnet.sonic.game',
        signTransaction:     (tx) => wallet.signTransaction(tx),
        signAllTransactions: (txs) => wallet.signAllTransactions(txs),
        publicKey:           new PublicKey(wallet.publicKey.toBytes()),
    }, {
        lsdProgramId:        '',
        stakeManagerAddress: '',
    },
    
    // Your project identifier for off-chain analysis. e.g. 'chaos-finance' / 'fomoney'
    // It's recommended to contact Chaos Finance to prevent identifier collisions.
    ''
)
```

### registerChain()

```javascript
registerChain(
    'https://api.testnet.sonic.game', // REST Endpoint
    '<lsd program id>', // LSD Program ID
    '<stake manager address>', // Stake Manager Address
    
    // Project ID, Your project identifier for off-chain analysis. e.g. 'chaos-finance' / 'fomoney'
    // It's recommended to contact Chaos Finance to prevent identifier collisions.
    ''
)
```

### registerWallet()

```javascript
const wallet = // Get the wallet object that user selected
await wallet.connect()

registerWallet(
    (tx) => wallet.signTransaction(tx),       // sign transaction function
    (txs) => wallet.signAllTransactions(txs), // sign all transactions function
    new PublicKey(wallet.publicKey.toBytes()) // public key
)
```

### updatePublicKey()

Set new public key when account changes. 

```javascript
const newPublicKey = new PublicKey(wallet.publicKey.toBytes()) 
updatePublicKey(newPublicKey)
```


## Mutating Functions

### stakeSonic()

Developers should make sure that the stakeAmount is greater or equal to [the userMinStakeAmount](#getuserminstakeamount) before sending the stake tx, otherwise it fails.

```javascript
const stakeAmount = // **get the amount from user input**
const stakeTxHash = await stakeSonic(stakeAmount)
if (stakeTxHash) {
    // handle success logic
} else {
    // alert user with failed messages
}
```

### unstakeLstSonic()

All LST holders are eligible to call `unstakeLstSonic` function to exchange their LST for SONIC.

```javascript
const unstakeLstAmount = // **get the amount from user input**
const txHash = await unstakeLstSonic(unstakeLstAmount)
if (txHash) {
    // handle success logic
} else {
    // alert user with failed messages
}
```

### withdrawSonic()

Call this function to withdraw the amount of `claimableAmount` SONIC that the api [getUserWithdrawInfo\(\)](#getuserwithdrawinfo) returns.

```javascript
const txHash = await withdrawSonic()
if (txHash) {
    // handle success logic
} else {
    // alert user with failed messages
}
```

## Global Query Functions

### getUserMinStakeAmount()

Query the minimum amount of SONIC that users can stake.

```javascript
const amount = await getUserMinStakeAmount()
```

### getLstApr()
Get the current Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for staking

```javascript
const currentApr = await getLstApr()
// output: 0.12 = 12%
```

### getLstRate()
Get the lst rate how many SONIC does 1 LST worth.

```javascript
const rate = await getLstRate()
// output: 1.09  which means 1 LST = 1.09 SONIC
```

Before staking users can pre calculate the amount of LST they will receive by:

```javascript
lstAmount = stakeAmount / rate
// e.g. 9.1743(LST) = 10 (SONIC) / 1.09
```

The unstake amount of SONIC that users will receive can be calculated with:

```javascript
sonicAmount = unstakeLstAmount * rate
// e.g. 10.9(SONIC) = 10 (LST) * 1.09
```

### getPlatformFeeCommission()

Get the platform's commission rate, expressed with 9 decimal places. For example, a value of 50,000,000 represents a commission rate of 5%.

```javascript
const commissionRate = getPlatformFeeCommission()
```

### getLsdTokenAddress()

Get the LSD Token mint address and SONIC token mint address.

```javascript
const lsdTokenAddress = getLsdTokenAddress()
// output: {
//    lsdTokenMintAddress: string,
//    sonicTokenMintAddress: string,
// }
```

### getTotalStakedAmount()

Get the total amount of SONIC staked in the LSD network.

```javascript
const totalStakedAmount = await getTotalStakedAmount()
```

### getTotalLstAmount()

Get the total amount of LSD tokens in the LSD network.

```javascript
const totalLstAmount = await getTotalLstAmount()
```

## User Query Functions

### getUserLstBalance()

When the stake tx get confirmed, call `getUserLstBalance()` to get the amount of user's lstSonic.

```javascript
const amount = await getUserLstBalance()
```

### getUserWithdrawInfo()
After unstake, developers should query withdrawal info. It returns:

1. overallAmount: the total amount of SONIC the user can withdraw after the waiting period.
2. claimableAmount: the amount of SONIC that user can currently withdraw.
3. remainingTimeInSeconds: the number of seconds the user needs to wait before they can call `withdrawSonic` function.

```javascript
// export interface WithdrawInfo {
//   overallAmount: string;
//   claimableAmount: string;
//   remainingTimeInSeconds: number;
// }

import { getUserWithdrawInfo, WithdrawInfo } from "@chaosfinance/sonic-lsd"

const info: WithdrawInfo = await getUserWithdrawInfo()
```


### getUserSolBalance()
Get SOL balance of the current wallet. 

```javascript
const balance = await getUserSolBalance()
// output: 1.25 (unit SOL)
```

### getUserSonicBalance()
Get SONIC balance of the current wallet. 

```javascript
const balance = await getUserSonicBalance()
// output: 1.68 (unit SONIC)
```

### getUserStakedAmount()

Get total amount of SONIC token the current user staked.

```javascript
const balance = await getUserStakedAmount()
// output: 1.68 (unit SONIC)
```
