title: Set up Staking Vault
---

Chaos Finance Staking Vault as a service allows token teams to create their own staking vaults with LST.
At the initial stage, token teams should contact the Chaos Finance team to set up a staking vault for their token.

Before launching a staking vault project, token teams need to provide:

### 1. Staking Token Address
The address of the token you want users to stake.

### 2. Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
The yearly interest rate paid to stakers, e.g. 10%.

### 3. Initial Total Reward

The amount of tokens allocated as the initial reward for the project. Teams must transfer these tokens to the Chaos Finance team.

Note: Rewards require ongoing contributions to maintain sustainability.

### 4. Unbonding Period
The time users must wait after initiating an unstake request before they can withdraw their tokens.
This period ensures stability and fair reward distribution.
Usually, it should be between 3 and 21 days.
