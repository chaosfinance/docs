description: The sSONIC tokens are interest-bearing while retaining full liquidity within the SONIC ecosystem.
---

sSONIC can be seamlessly integrated into various **GameFi** and **DeFi** applications within the SONIC network, opening up new opportunities for yield generation across the **SONIC SVM**.

---

## Stake

The staking process in Chao Finance is similar to other liquid staking protocols. Holders can stake **SONIC** through the frontend apps—whether it’s the **Chao App** or other integrated frontends within games. Upon staking, users will receive the corresponding amount of **sSONIC** directly in their wallets.

---

## Redeem

**sSONIC** holders can redeem their staked SONIC on-chain at any time. However, per the mechanism designed by the SONIC team, the initial redemption period will only be activated three months after the launch of Chao Finance. After this period, redemptions can be processed anytime, with the waiting time dependent on the available SONIC balance in the **Redeem Pool**.

- If the redemption amount is **less than the available SONIC** in the Redeem Pool, users will receive their SONIC **immediately**.
- If the redemption amount **exceeds the pool balance**, the remaining SONIC will be returned gradually, with the waiting period depending on the pool's replenishment cycle. The Redeem Pool updates **every 24 hours**, adding new unstaked SONIC to fulfill pending requests.

Redemptions follow a **first-come, first-served** basis, ensuring fairness among redeemers. In the app, users will see the estimated waiting period before executing their redemption requests.

> Note: The longest possible waiting period will not exceed 3 months.

---

## Withdraw

Stakers can withdraw their **unstaked SONIC** after the locking period ends. Once withdrawn, the SONIC will be transferred directly to the user’s wallet. If the withdrawal is not initiated, the SONIC will remain securely in the contract address. Withdrawals can be executed at any time after the lock period is completed.

## Exchange Rate

**rSONIC** is an interest-bearing asset that provides liquidity while continuously accumulating rewards. These rewards dynamically grow and are derived from the **SONIC Staking Contract**.

In **Chao Finance**, the SONIC staked through the app is deposited into the **SONIC Staking Vault** every 24 hours, where it begins accruing rewards. The accumulated rewards are periodically calculated and reflected in the **exchange rate**, which is recorded on-chain. This on-chain rate is then used to determine the amount of SONIC users receive when they redeem their holdings.

Since the protocol does not implement a **slashing mechanism**, the exchange rate **can only increase** as rewards accumulate. As a result, later redeemers may receive a larger amount of SONIC upon redemption compared to earlier redeemers.

---

## Yield

Under the design of the **SONIC staking mechanism**, the **SONIC Staking Vault** will be migrated to the **SONIC SVM** upon launch, ensuring that the current **APY** from the **Solana Vault** is maintained.

To ensure the fungibility of **sSONIC**, the **Chao Finance** will initially offer a **single staking option** with a **3-month lock-in period**, tied to a specific APY provided by the Vault. In the future, **Chao Finance** plans to introduce longer staking periods, which could offer stakers the potential for higher yields and greater flexibility.
