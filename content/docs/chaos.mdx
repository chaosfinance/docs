**Chaos Finance** is a SONIC liquid staking protocol powered by **StaFi AI LSaaS**. It allows **SONIC** token holders to stake their assets and receive **Liquid Staking SONIC (sSONIC)** in return. The sSONIC tokens are interest-bearing while retaining full liquidity within the SONIC ecosystem.

sSONIC can be seamlessly integrated into various **GameFi** and **DeFi** applications within the SONIC network, opening up new opportunities for yield generation across the **SONIC SVM**.
