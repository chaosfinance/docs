## From Sonic to Chaos

The DeFi landscape continues to evolve, with new bridges forming between blockchain technology and real-world applications. Emerging from this innovation is **Chaos Finance** – a premier Liquid Staking protocol on [Sonic SVM](https://www.sonic.game/) powered by [StaFi AI LSaaS](https://www.stafi.io/lsaas/) technology.

We're building essential liquidity protocols that form the backbone of Sonic's gaming-focused ecosystem. Inspired by **Solana Foundation Chair Lily Liu's** _"Buy Now, Pay Never"_ concept, Chaos Finance is creating a future where Sonic gamers enjoy premium experiences and make in-game purchases without direct payment – with transactions quietly settled through Sonic's staking yields in the background.

This isn't just about revolutionizing staking – it's about expanding Sonic's reach beyond crypto enthusiasts to welcome mainstream gamers into the ecosystem.

## Chaos Finance: Unlocking Value

Chaos FinanceE transforms how SONIC token holders generate yield. While SONIC traditionally offers three staking options (3, 6, or 12-month lockups), staking through Chaos FinanceE provides sSONIC – an interest-bearing token with complete liquidity within the SONIC ecosystem. sSONIC can be seamlessly integrated into various GameFi and DeFi applications within the SONIC network, opening up new opportunities for yield generation across the SONIC SVM.
