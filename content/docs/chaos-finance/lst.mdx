sSONIC can be seamlessly integrated into various **GameFi** and **DeFi** applications within the SONIC network, opening up new opportunities for yield generation across the **SONIC SVM**.

## Stake

The staking process in Chaos Finance is similar to other liquid staking protocols. Holders can stake **SONIC** through the frontend apps—whether it’s the **Chaos App** or other integrated frontends within games. Upon staking, users will receive the corresponding amount of **sSONIC** directly in their wallets.

## Unstake

The redemption process is divided into two actions: **unstake** and **withdraw**. Initially **sSONIC** holders submit an unstake request to burn their LSD tokens, thereby reserving a position for the equivalent amount of SONIC for later withdrawal. Since the tokens have been burnt, no rewards will be accrued after the unstake request.

## Withdraw

According to the staking mechanism designed by the SONIC team, the withdrawal period will become active on 2025-06-02, three months after the launch of Chaos Finance. Until this activation, withdrawal requests cannot be processed. Typically, users must wait between one day and up to 3 months after their unstake requests before they can withdraw their SONIC. The timing varies as follows:
- Every 24 hours, Chaos Finance receives the principal and rewards from the SONIC chain.
- If the received amount is less than the pending withdrawal requests, the amount accumulates.
- If the accumulated amount exceeds the pending withdrawal requests, users can withdraw their SONIC **immediately**.
- The withdrawal process follows a **first-come, first-served** basis, ensuring fairness among unstakers. Users will see the estimated waiting period in the app before executing their withdrawal requests.

> Note: The longest possible waiting period would never exceed three months.

## Rewards Distribution

Rewards distribution is crucial to all participants. Chaos Finance has set the commission fee at 10% of the rewards. For example, if 100 SONIC in rewards is received from the chain, the distribution will be as follows:

| Role | Amount | Formula |
|----------------|------|--------------|
|  Users         |  90  | 100*(1-0.1)  |
|  Chaos Finance |  10  | 100*0.1      |

## Exchange Rate

**sSONIC** is an interest-bearing asset that provides liquidity while continuously accumulating rewards. These rewards dynamically grow and are derived from the **SONIC Staking Contract**.

In **Chaos Finance**, the SONIC staked through the app is deposited into the **SONIC Staking Vault** every 24 hours, where it begins accruing rewards. The accumulated rewards are periodically calculated and reflected in the **exchange rate**, which is recorded on-chain. This on-chain rate is then used to determine the amount of SONIC users receive when they redeem their holdings.

Since the protocol does not implement a **slashing mechanism**, the exchange rate **can only increase** as rewards accumulate. As a result, later redeemers may receive a larger amount of SONIC upon redemption compared to earlier redeemers.

The sSONIC exchange rate($C_{r}$) is determined by a number of factors, including:

- The total amount of SONIC staked in the Staking Contract: $Q_{tsk}$
- The total amount of redeemed SONIC: $Q_{red}$
- The amount of staking rewards: $Q_{rew}$
- The commission ratio: $R_{com}$
- The total amount of sSONIC minted: M
- The total amount of sSONIC burned: N

In general, the exchange rate is positively correlated with the staking income, which is influenced by these variables. The exact formula for calculating the sSONIC exchange rate is as follows:

```math
C_{i}={[\left(Q_{stk}-Q_{red}\right)+Q_{rew} *\left(1-R_{com}\right)]}/{(M-N)}
```

## Yield

Under the design of the **SONIC staking mechanism**, the **SONIC Staking Vault** will be migrated to the **SONIC SVM** upon launch, ensuring that the current **APY** from the **Solana Vault** is maintained.

To ensure the fungibility of **sSONIC**, the **Chaos Finance** will initially offer a **single staking option** with a **3-month lock-in period**, tied to a specific APY provided by the Vault. In the future, **Chaos Finance** plans to introduce longer staking periods, which could offer stakers the potential for higher yields and greater flexibility.
